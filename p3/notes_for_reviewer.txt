Map of choice: Krak√≥w (Cracow), Poland

OSM map: https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2768922

https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts, city name 'Krakow'

I've chosen this map because it's the city I live in - I wanted to find out how robust the data about the Cracow already is and if I can improve it somehow.
